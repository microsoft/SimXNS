[SimXNS](https://aka.ms/simxns) is a research project for information retrieval by MSRA NLC team. Some of the techniques are actively used in [Microsoft Bing](https://www.bing.com/). This repo provides the official code implementations.

Currently, this repo contains several methods that are designed for or related to information retrieval.
Here are some basic descriptions to help you catch up with the characteristics of each work:
- [**SimANS**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11773) is a simple, general and flexible ambiguous negatives sampling method for dense text retrieval. It can be easily applied to various dense retrieval methods like [AR2](https://github.com/microsoft/AR2). This method is also applied in [Bing](https://www.bing.com/) search engine, which is proven to be effective.
- [**MASTER**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07841) is a multi-task pre-trained model that unifies and integrates multiple pre-training tasks with different learning objectives under the bottlenecked masked autoencoder architecture.
- [**PROD**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13335) is a novel distillation framework for dense retrieval, which consists of a teacher progressive distillation and a data progressive distillation to gradually improve the student.
- [**CAPSTONE**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09114) is a curriculum sampling for dense retrieval with document expansion, to bridge the gap between training and inference for dual-cross-encoder.
- [**ALLIES**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14766) leverages LLMs to iteratively generate new queries related to the original query, enabling an iterative reasoning process. By iteratively refining and expanding the scope of the original query, ALLIES captures and utilizes hidden knowledge that may not be directly obtainable through retrieval.
- [**LEAD**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05225) aligns the layer features of student and teacher, emphasizing more on the informative layers by re-weighting.
